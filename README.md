# Boot camp Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This study guide was created for boot camp students going through prework. I built this project in order to provide an easily accessible resource guide with important tips and definitions from my module notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. This webpage solves the problem of beginner web developers needing a resource for information to study in order to help them better understand the basics of building webpage applications. A basic, but very important, thing that I learned is that building a webpage application starts with the HTML frame, adding style with CSS, and adding interactivity with JavaScript, all while following the Git workflow.
