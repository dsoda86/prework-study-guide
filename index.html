          <li>The parent element is the element that holds all the children</li>
          <li>In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage</li>
          <li>Non-semantic elements such as 'div' and 'span' are used to create division</li>
          <li>When working with visible HTML elements, the content is contained between an opening tag and a closing</li>
          <li>Difference between element and tag. An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag; whereas a tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets</li>
          <li>The 'h1', 'h2', 'h3', 'h4', 'h5', and 'h6' elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents</li>
          <li>The 'p' element represents a paragraph or block of text</li>

          <li>pull request (PR): asking for changes on a branch to merge into another branch</li>
          <li>merge: when a PR is approved, changes are pulled in or merged into main branch</li>
          <li>Issue: a way to report new tasks or content fixes</li>
          <li>When naming a repository, remember to: be unique and descriptive for each repo name, use all lowercase letters, use dashes instead of spaces, and be consistent</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>

          <li>Markdown(.md): the way content files are formatted, in plain text, which easily converts to HTML</li>
          <li>git add -A: the add command adds modifications in the current working branch to the staging area and the -A flag indicates that we want to add all changes</li>
          <li>git commit -m "commit message describing what the commit contains": commit created that captures a snapshot of the currently staged changes</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: used to make sure local branch is in sync with base branch in GitHub</li>
          <li>It is important to always to a git pull to make sure that you have the latest version of the projext on your local computer before you start to work</li>
          <li>git push origin branch-name: pushes changes from local branch to remote branch</li>
          <li>code .:opens current directory in VS Code</li>
