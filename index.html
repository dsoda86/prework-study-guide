        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <u1>
          <li>HTML is Hypertext Markup Language and is used to create the structure of a webpage</li>
          <li>An element is a type of content on a webpage</li>
          <li>Text, Image, Header, and List elements are commonly used to add content to pages</li>
          <li>Meta-related, Content division, and Semantic elements are used to divide and describe a page</li>
          <li>When developing a webpage, first, we use HTML elements as the building blocks of our sturdy frame</li>
          <li>HTML elements are case-sensitive, while declarations are not case-sensitive</li>
          <li>Metadata is data about a webpage that the browser uses to effectively server the webpage to users</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>
          <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage. It is required and is important for Search Engine Optimization(SEO)</li>
          <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website</li>
          <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage</li>
          <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document</li>
          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set. description, keywords, author, and viewport</li>
          <li>The script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document</li>
          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements</li>
          <li>The parent element is the element that holds all the children</li>
          <li>In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage</li>
          <li>Non-semantic elements such as 'div' and 'span' are used to create division</li>
          <li>When working with visible HTML elements, the content is contained between an opening tag and a closing</li>
          <li>Difference between element and tag. An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag; whereas a tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets</li>
          <li>The 'h1', 'h2', 'h3', 'h4', 'h5', and 'h6' elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents</li>
          <li>The 'p' element represents a paragraph or block of text</li>
          <li>The 'u1', 'o1', and 'li' elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items</li>
          <li>The 'img' element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage</li>
          <li>The 'img' element can contain various attributes; the 'src' attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image</li>
          <li>The 'br' element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content</li>
          <li>The 'a' element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same or other webpages</li>
          <li>The 'href' atttribute points to the URL for the link</li>
          <li>The 'src' attribute defines the location, or source of the image file</li>
          <li>The 'alt' attribute contains a text string that describes the appearance and functionality of the image</li>
          <li>The footer element appears at the bottom of the page and usually contains the author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation</li>
          <li>Section elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content</li>
          <li>The 'id' attribute is used as a way to identify elements and select them (class attribute works similarly)</li>
          <li>Developers test code early and often to catch bugs; sometimes this can be as simple as looking for changes in the browser to see if a webpage is rendering as expected</li>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <u1>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet</li>
          <li>Inline CSS styles an element directly in the HTML files and are useful for quick and permanent changes</li>
          <li>Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a specific page element only</li>
          <li>It is possible to embed an entire style sheet directly in the HTML file using a style element in the head element</li>
          <li>Internal style sheets contain CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file with those rules only applying to that page</li>
          <li>External CSS style sheet is the most common way to style a webpage and is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier</li>
          <li>When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a link element placed in the HTML's head element</li>
          <li>Separation of conerns refers to separating code into different files based on used</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations , will apply</li>
          <li>Declarations have two components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of that property</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
          <li>When you increase padding, the entire element is made bigger because the padding is located inside the element; as opposed to the margin, which is the transparent buffer outside the element</li>
          <li>CSS box model: Every HTML element is essentially a box; where each box consists of margins outside the element, and the element's borders, padding, and content</li>
          <li>The * symbol is used to apply a rule to all elements visible on the page</li>
          <li>Two selectors can be combined into a single CSS rule with a comma, allowing the declarations to affect both selectors</li>
          <li>Do Not Repeat Yourseld (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lones of code that need to be written or maintained</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector</li>
          <li>Assigning colors in CSS can be done by semantic references such as 'blue' or by referring to a color by its hex #</li>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <u1>
          <li>Git is version control for developers</li>
          <li>Every project on GitHub is called a repository (repo), a folder for your project that contains all of the files and their revision history</li>
          <li>commit changes: saving a new version of a file you are working on</li>
          <li>pull request (PR): asking for changes on a branch to merge into another branch</li>
          <li>merge: when a PR is approved, changes are pulled in or merged into main branch</li>
          <li>Issue: a way to report new tasks or content fixes</li>
          <li>When naming a repository, remember to: be unique and descriptive for each repo name, use all lowercase letters, use dashes instead of spaces, and be consistent</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>Branch: workspace where you can make changes that don't affect the live site</li>
          <li>Markdown(.md): the way content files are formatted, in plain text, which easily converts to HTML</li>
          <li>git add -A: the add command adds modifications in the current working branch to the staging area and the -A flag indicates that we want to add all changes</li>
          <li>git commit -m "commit message describing what the commit contains": commit created that captures a snapshot of the currently staged changes</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: used to make sure local branch is in sync with base branch in GitHub</li>
          <li>It is important to always to a git pull to make sure that you have the latest version of the projext on your local computer before you start to work</li>
          <li>git push origin branch-name: pushes changes from local branch to remote branch</li>
          <li>code .:opens current directory in VS Code</li>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <u1>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>Link a JavaScript file to the index.html file by enterning code on a new line under the footer element and before the /body element near the bottom</li>
          <li>The browser reads code in the order that it appears in the file</li>
          <li>Use the 'var' keyword, followed by a unique variable name, '=' assign the specific data that we want stored in the variable</li>
          <li>Variables can contain a string, which are surrounded by quotation marks</li>
          <li>Use the console.log() method to output a message to the web console by adding an argument</li>
          <li>Console refers to a test environment that developers use to check out their code</li>
          <li>The .log() part of console.log is a method, which means a set of instructions that can be executed</li>
          <li>The .log() method will output whatever we add inside the parentheses to the consol</li>
          <li>Use the Chrome DevTools to view the console.log output via the console tab</li>
          <li>We can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all</li>
          <li>An 'if' statement is a way of introducing decision-making into our code</li>
          <li>A value is considered falsy if it is one of the following values: 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean data type with the value of false</li>
          <li>We can use 'if' and 'else if' to add multiple condtions to our code</li>
          <li>The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two calues are equal, and returns a Boolean result 'true' if the values are equal and 'false' if the values are not equal</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data that is typcally related in some way</li>
          <li>Arrays are especially useful when we want to perform a task on mutliple pieces of data at once</li>
          <li>A single array can store different types of data, such as strings, numbers, and many more</li>
          <li>An index is number that identifies the unique location of a data item in an array</li>
          <li>In JavaScript and many other programming languages, arrays are zero-indexed and sequential</li>
          <li>The 'for loop' uses the predictable pattern if indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over</li>
          <li>The first statement in a 'for loop' determines the starting point for the loop, i.e. var x = 0.</li>
          <li>The second statement in a 'for loop' is the condition.</li>
          <li>The final statemtn in a 'for loop' is what allows the array to iterate over each item, i.e. x++, followed by a console.lo().</li>
          <li>Commenting out code makes it inactive without deleting it and is done by using /* before and */ after the block of code.</li>
          <li>A function is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task</li>
          <li>Functions do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file is run</li>
          <li>A function must be called by name in order to execute it and can be called as many times as we need</li>
          <li>A function's name is followed by ()</li>
          <li>It is common practice to indent the 'for loop' code below the finction name, within the curly brackets, to add visual structure to your code</li>
          <li>To declare a funtion we use the function keywork and then give it a unique name followed by parenthese, with curly brackets containing the code for the task we want to perform added to it</li>
